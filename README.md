# BdExtension
An extension for Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction
- Display last modification time and size of files.
- Make csv file viewing easier on Jupyter Notebook. When the csv file is too larg, this extension can help you open it quickly. And at the same time, you can do some computation such as sorting, summing. While you click a computing button(Sort, Sum, Aevrage or Max), the server will compute it in a parallel manner.

## Install (Linux)
```
./install.sh
```
